# Algorithms-Visualised-using-python


This project was created to visualise various basic AI Algorithms such as Greedy BFS, DFS, Min-Max, etc. using examples such as Vaccum World, 8-Queens, etc. Here are all the examples used along with Algorithms they were used with:

## Vaccum World
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search
- Iterative Deepening Search

## Graph Traversal
- Greedy Breadth First Search
- A* algorithm

## 8-Queens Problem
- Hill Climbing Algorithm
- Evolutionary/Genetic Algorithm

## Tic-Tac-Toe move suggestions
- Min-Max Algorithm
